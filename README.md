# 3D printable and scalable spacer for marble run
This is a parametric model of a spacer, suitable e.g. for the "GRAVITRAX(R) Marble Run & STEM Toy". It can be 3D printed with the flat side down without support grid. By defining the height units (1 HU = 10mm) the model is scaled. All relevant measures are parameters and the dependencies are calculated automatically.

There are prepared spacers (slicer-ready STL) with one, three, five and ten height units.

I printed the parts with black PLA with 0,2mm layer height/15% infill/0,4mm nozzle and they fit well.

The part is modeled with [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).
